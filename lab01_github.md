Markdown is a way to write content for the web. 
Plain markdown is just a very simple format for marking up
texts. Unlike write text in a word editor, there is nothing
hidden in a markdown file. If you want something to be in
italics, surround it in single stars like *this*. For bold,
use **two**.

Complete the following items using Markdown using [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

- Set-up a GitHub account. 
- Create and italicize an H2 header call "A Favorite Quote". 
- Below that header, provide your favority quote stylized as a block quote. 
- Create and italicize a second H2 header called "A Favorite Photo". 
- Add a photo and make sure to give credit by linking to the source.   
- Create and italicize a second H2 header called "A Favorite Photo". 
- Answer the following statement "The biggest questions I have going into this class are:". Your answer should be formated as a list.

## The biggest questions I have going into this class are:
1. What is the purpose of digital humanities?
2. How will we use Markdown in the class?
3. How does the digital humanities relate to rhetoric?
### Playing Around
1. Hi Dr. Tilton!
2. I really hope I'm doing this correctly!

   It's a little confusing!

>But I hope to get the hang of it soon
