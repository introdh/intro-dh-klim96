## Reading Prompt

For each reading, pick two sentence/passages. One should be where the had an AHA! moment and one that is unclear, confusing, or needs further explanation. Provide a sentence or two explaining each of your selections.  Provide your response below.

 

### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
#### Moretti Reading
> **AHA!:** "'Distant reading', I have once called this type of approach; where distance is however not an obstacle but a specific form of knowledge: fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection."

Though this sentence is still vague, it helped me get a general idea of what our topic of discussion would be for this week.

> **UNCLEAR:** "The distant reason for these choices lies in my Marxist formation, which was profoundly influnced by Galvano DellaVolpe, and enailed therefore (in principle, if not always in practice) a great respect for the scientific spirit."

With this sentence, I lost Moretti's interpretation of "distant." What makes the reasoning for this distant?

#### Schutlz Reading
> **AHA!:** "O.K., he means the protagonist is the character with the smallest average degree of separation from the others, 'the center of the network.'"

This was a very helpful example of Moretti's work that really clicked in my head. It shows how Moretti's work is intuitive but also insightful.

> **UNCLEAR:** "Somewhere along the line, he writes, he 'drifted from quanitification to the qualitative analysis of plot.'"

Now I am unsure of what is Moretti's work and what is the purpose of distant reading and literary experimentation.

#### Jockers Reading
> **AHA!:** "Like it or not, today's literary-historical scholar can no longer risk being *just* a closer reader: the sheer quantity of available data makes the traditional practice of close reading untenable as an exhaustive or definitive method of evidence gathering."

This quote helped bring all three readings together and helped me bertter understand the purpose of distant reading and its relationship to the digital humanities. In addition, I can relate to this quote because as a student of the humanities — and even in the social sciences — I feel like I need to know *everything* in my field, especially since it is all easily accessible with a quick Google search.

> **UNCLEAR:** "As 'findings,' not 'interpretations,' they have about them a deceptive simplicity, a simplicity or finality that appears to render them 'uninteresting' to scholars conditioned to reject the idea of a closed argument."

This quote is in reference to John Burrows's analysis of Jane Austen's works; I am not sure what Jockers is saying about simplicity and the difference between findings and interpretations.

### 2017-09-25: Topic modeling I
#### Brett Reading
> **AHA!:** "One way to think about how the process of topic modeling works is to imagine working through an article with a set of highlighters. As you read through the article, you use a different color for the key words of themes within the paper as you come across them. When you were done, you could copy out the words as grouped by the color you assigned them. That list of words is a topic, and each color represents a different topic."

As someone who obsessively highlights her readings, I was able to relate to this quote, which helped in my understanding of topic modeling.

> **UNCLEAR:** "The only way to know if your results are useful or widly off the mark is to have a general idea of what you should be seeing."

As someone from a psychology background, I constantly worry about researcher bias tainting results; however, I am also a rhetoric major, so I understand that humanities work includes interpretation and that knowing the context of one's work is helpful in interpreting results. However, I wonder how digital humanities researchers deal with bias in their work.

#### Weingart and Meeks Reading
> **AHA!:** "[Topic modeling] is distant reading in the most pure sense: focused on corpora and not individual texts, treating the works themselves as unceremonious 'buckets of words,' and providing seductive but obscure results in the forms of easily interpreted (and manipulated) 'topics.'"

This quote, along with the quote from the Brett reading, helped me to understand topic modeling.

> **UNCLEAR:** "In this additional way topic modeling typifies digital humanities: the work is almost entirely represented in that gray literature."

In rhetoric, we are always talking about breaking out of the "ivory tower" of academia. Is that what this quote and the paragraph that follows are referring to?

#### Blevins Reading
> **UNCLEAR:** "The diary's format translates nicely into creating a list of lists - the 'main' diary being a list of all the entries, and each entry being a list in and of itself."

This quote and the breakdown that follows it were confusing; I am unsure why Blevins broke the diary down into "a list of lists," what it means, and what its purpose is.

> **AHA!:** Once the data was scrubbed, we could turn to writing a program that would count the number of deliveries recorded in the diary."

After I read Blevins's example of counting the deliveries in Ballard's diary, I was able to better understand what Blevins was doing and how she was doing it.

#### Goldstone and Underwood Reading

> **AHA!:** "[Topic modeling] has the potential to reveal shifts in critical vocabulary that aren't well described, and that don't fit our received assumptions about the history of the discipline."

Goldstone and Underwood's explanation of how we can use topic modeling to show subtle, rhetorical differences and how these trends that may go unnoticed can be important was helpful for me to understand the purpose of topic modeling; through my work with the Race and Racism at UR project and in my rhetoric classes, I learned the importance of uncovering data that history has kept hidden.

> **UNCLEAR:** "As you vary the overall number of topics, some topics seem to simply disappear."

I am unsure of what Goldstone and Underwood mean by this and the example that followed was very difficult to understand.

### 2017-10-02: Topic Modeling II
#### Robinson Reading
> **AHA!:** "My analysis, shown below, concludes that the Android and iPhone tweets are clearly from different people, posting during different times of day and using hashtags, links, and retweets in distinct ways. What's more, we can see that the Android tweets are angrier and more negative, while iPhone tweets tend to be benign announcements and pictures."

Robinson's thesis at the beginning of his article helped with my reading of this article; I was able to relate all the analyses he did back to this thesis and it gave the article a lot of focus.

> **UNCLEAR:** "We start by dividing into individual words using the unnest_tokens function..."

Perhaps it is because I don't know how the tidytext package works, but how do we decide which words we're dividing into? Or is this similar to our readings last week on topic modeling where we tell the program how many words to give us?

#### Gamerman Reading
> **AHA!:** "Such findings make sense for a first novel, the academics said, since many authors submit manuscripts that are a raw initial account in their own voice."

This sentence was helpful in my understanding of the purpose of this article since I am not familiar with the ***To Kill a Mockingbird*** versus ***Go Set a Watchman*** authorship debate.

> **UNCLEAR:** "The researchers used a computer program to tally the frequency of common words—'the,' 'a,' 'he,' 'she'—and other 'function' words that they said typically make up 50% of a novel."

In the Jockers reading, Burrows also utilized this strategy when analyzing Jane Austen's works. How does tallying common words help researchers determine the writer and style?

#### Mining the Dispatch
> **AHA!:** "This project, '***Mining the Dispatch***,' seeks to explore—and encourage exploration of—the dramatic and often traumatic changes as well as the sometimes surprising continuities in the social and political life of Civil War Richmond. ... It uses as its principle methodology topic modeling, a computational, probabilistic technique to uncover categories and discover patterns in and among texts."

I think this paragraph does a really good job of explaining the purpose of the project and how its methods connect to its research goals. It helped ground our readings and discussions about topic modeling last week in a more concrete example.

> **UNCLEAR:** "The topics 'poetry and patriotism' and 'anti-northern diatribes' both aimed to motivate southerners to rally to the Confederate cause."

Last week, we discussed the different parts to topic modeling and we briefly touched on themes in topic modeling. Would these two examples would be the topics and would motivating to rally around the Confederate cause be the theme?

#### Signs at 40
> **AHA!:** "The topic model offers pathways through the overall tendencies that have characterized the journal and novel routes to particular articles from the journal’s run so far."

Again, this sentence does a good job of explaining how the method of topic modeling connects to the project's purpose, which is helpful in my understanding of the project and topic modeling.

> **UNCLEAR:** "Common words with flexible meanings are not always handled well by the modeling process, and as a result there are certain topics in our model that we have found to be more confusing than enlightening for exploring the Signs archive. We have hidden these, so that of the 70 topics only 67 are normally included in the listings and visualizations here."

Last week, we discussed how "date" could have multiple meanings—a romantic event, a time, or a fruit. Are these topics "hidden" because the program and researchers were not able to go through the corpus and differentiate these meanings?

### 2017-10-09: Stylometry

### 2017-10-18: Spatial history
#### Bodenhamer Reading
> **AHA!:** "Subject matter, once organized largely as periods and eras, increasingly is ordered under spatial themes, such as region, diaspora, contact zones, and borders or boundaries, among others."

These are great examples and a good contrast that helped me form my understanding of spatial history.

> **UNCLEAR:** "For many humanists, space itself became less geographical and more metaphorical, as scholars found richer meaning in conceptual space—for instance, gendered space, racialized space, or the body as space—than in categories related to the physical environment, the traditional frame of definition for spatial terms."

I am confused by what he means by metaphorical, or conceptual, space.

#### Shnayder Reading
> **AHA!:** "Once data is entered into the geodatabase, the Western Railroads Geodatabase allows for comprehensive searches through the ArcGIS 'find' feature in conjunction with all of the other inputted data sources. For example, we can search the entire geodatabase to see all of the lines operated by a specific railroad company, and then further investigate this company’s history by seeing where they first built rail tracks.

This was helpful in understanding how the geodatabase works.

> **UNCLEAR:** "Like other historians, we also use historical maps, but we differ in trying to systematically correlate and merge them with other data."

How does one correlate and merge historical maps and how does this method help in Shnayder and White's goals?

#### White Reading
> **AHA!:** "

> **UNCLEAR:** "
