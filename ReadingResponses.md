### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
#### Moretti Reading
> AHA!: "'Distant reading', I have once called this type of approach; where distance is however not an obstacle but a specific form of knowledge: fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection."

Though this sentence is still vague, it helped me get a general idea of what our topic of discussion would be for this week.

> UNCLEAR: "The distant reason for these choices lies in my Marxist formation, which was profoundly influnced by Galvano DellaVolpe, and enailed therefore (in principle, if not always in practice) a great respect for the scientific spirit."

With this sentence, I lost Moretti's interpretation of "distant"; what makes the reasoning for this distant?

#### Schutlz Reading
> AHA!: "O.K., he means the protagonist is the character with the smallest average degree of separation from the others, 'the center of the network.'"

This was a very helpful example of Moretti's work that really clicked in my head. It shows how Moretti's work is intuitive but also insightful.

> UNCLEAR: "Somewhere along the line, he writes, he 'drifted from quanitification to the qualitative analysis of plot.'"

Now I am unsure of what is Moretti's work and what is the purpose of distant reading and literary experimentation.

#### Jockers Reading
>AHA!: "Like it or not, today's literary-historical scholar can no longer risk being *just* a closer reader: the sheer quantity of available data makes the traditional practice of close reading untenable as an exhaustive or definitive method of evidence gathering."

This quote helped bring all three readings together and helped me bertter understand the purpose of distant reading and its relationship to the digital humanities. In addition, I can relate to this quote because as a student of the humanities — and even in the social sciences — I feel like I need to know *everything* in my field, especially since it is all easily accessible with a quick Google search.

>UNCLEAR: "As 'findings,' not 'interpretations,' they have about them a deceptive simplicity, a simplicity or finality that appears to render them 'uninteresting' to scholars conditioned to reject the idea of a closed argument."

This quote is in reference to John Burrows's analysis of Jane Austen's works; I am not sure what Jockers is explaining in terms of simplicity and the difference between findings and interpretations.
