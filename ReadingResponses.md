### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
#### Moretti Reading
> AHA!: "'Distant reading', I have once called this type of approach; where distance is however not an obstacle but a specific form of knowledge: fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection."

   Though this sentence is still vague, it helped me get a general idea of what our topic of discussion would be for this week.  

> UNCLEAR: "The distant reason for these choices lies in my Marxist formation, which was profoundly influnced by Galvano DellaVolpe, and enailed therefore (in principle, if not always in practice) a great respect for the scientific spirit."

   With this sentence, I lost Moretti's interpretation of "distant"; what makes the reasoning for this distant?  

#### Schutlz Reading
> AHA!: "O.K., he means the protagonist is the character with the smallest average degree of separation from the others, 'the center of the network.'"

   This was a very helpful example of Moretti's work that really clicked in my head. It shows how Moretti's work is intuitive but also insightful.  

> UNCLEAR: "Somewhere along the line, he writes, he 'drifted from quanitification to the qualitative analysis of plot.'"

   Now I am unsure of what is Moretti's work and what is the purpose of distant reading and literary experimentation.
