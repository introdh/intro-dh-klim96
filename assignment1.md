My object of study is Disney Princess movies, specifically the music in the films. Disney made history when it released a soundtrack for its first film, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*; according to Wikipedia, it is the first commercially released film soundtrack. Since then, the Disney Princess brand has grown and the music from the films are considered cultural icons.

From this data, I can see if there are trends in Disney Princess music, such as if a larger budget is related to more awards or greater popularity. I can also analyze if the composer or singers are related to the soundtrack’s popularity or the film’s gross. I may also be able to predict whether *Mulan*, *Princess and the Frog*, *Tangled*, and *Brave*’s soundtracks will be re-released if I compare their budgets and grosses to the films who have had their soundtracks re-released. If such trends exist, I can draw conclusions about how Disney invests in its Disney Princess films and the role the music plays in the films' and brand's success.

To figure out which films would be included, I went to the [Disney Princess Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Princess) and referenced the official [Disney Princess website](http://princess.disney.com/) to confirm that Wikipedia’s line-up was correct. 
To gather data for the films, I referenced each one’s Wikipedia page: [*Snow White*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_film)), [*Cinderella*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_(1950_film)), [*Sleeping Beauty*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_(1959_film)), [*The Little Mermaid*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(1989_film)), [*Beauty and the Beast*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(1991_film)), [*Aladdin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)), [*Pocahontas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocahontas_(1995_film)), [*Mulan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulan_(1998_film)), [*The Princess and the Frog*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_and_the_Frog), [*Tangled*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangled), and [*Brave*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(2012_film)). Each page has extensive information about each film.
I also referenced each film’s soundtrack Wikipedia page—if it exists—to gather data for the Disney Princess Soundtrack table: [*Snow White*'s soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(soundtrack)), [*The Little Mermaid*'s soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(soundtrack)), [*Beauty and the Beast*'s soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(1991_soundtrack)), [*Aladdin*'s soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(soundtrack)), [*Pocahontas*'s soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocahontas_(soundtrack)), [*Mulan*'s soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulan_(soundtrack)), [*The Princess and the Frog*'s soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_and_the_Frog_(soundtrack)), and [*Brave*'s soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(soundtrack)).

### Data Dictionary
* **Film**: Variable; this variable is the Disney Princess film.
* **Princess**: Variable; this is the princess that makes her debut in the film. Many of these princesses are based off of princesses in popular fairytales. Mulan and Pocahontas, however, are based on historical figures.
* **Animated or Computer Animated?**: Categorical; this variable distinguishes between animated, which is more 2-dimensional, and computer animated, which utilizes computer generated images (CGI), movies.
* **Release Date**: Date; this is the date the film was first released, whether it be at a film festival or a national release.
* **Composer**: Variable; this is the film’s composer, who wrote the music for the movie. The person listed is who is first billed on Wikipedia.
* **Princess Singing Voice**: Variable; this is the actress who provides the singing voice for the Disney princess featured in the film.

* **Prince Singing Voice**: Variable; this is the actor who provides the singing voice for the Disney prince featured in the film. Occasionally, this actor differs from the actor who provides the speaking voice for the prince; for example, Brad Kane provides Aladdin’s singing voice while Scott Weinger was Aladdin’s voice actor. In *The Little Mermaid*, Eric does not sing so there is no singing actor included; in *Brave*, Merida does not have a prince, so this observation is left blank as well.

* **Box Office Gross**: Numeric; this is the amount the film made at the box office in millions. The currency is American dollars.
* **Disney Era**: Categorical; this variable refers to the Disney Princess era during which the film was released. The three eras are Classic, Renaissance, and Modern.

* **Soundtrack Release Date**: Date; this is the date the soundtrack was released.

If the soundtrack was re-released, the observation is “Yes”; if it has not been re-released, the observation is “No.”
