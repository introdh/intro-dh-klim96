### Discuss the process of georeferencing and building your map.

To create my map, I first opened the Streets basemap in ArcGIS. I zoomed in on the east coast and found the islands off the coast of Southern New Jersey, one of which is Atlantic City. Once I felt that I had zoomed in enough, I opened the 1930s map of the Atlantic City area and placed it over the Streets basemap. Drawing on my experience with the Atlantic City Expressway and other major roads near Atlantic City, I picked intersections or unique roads that I found on both the basemap and the 1930s map and used these as my points of reference to align the 1930s map to the basemap. For example, I know there is a roundabout in Brigantine where there is a lighthouse; therefore, I found the roundabout on the 1930s map, put a point there, and placed the other point on the roundabout on the basemap. Even after two points, the 1930s map was well-aligned with the basemap.
