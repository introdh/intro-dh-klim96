### Discuss the process of georeferencing and building your map.

To create my map, I first opened the Streets basemap in ArcGIS. I zoomed in on the east coast and found the islands off the coast of Southern New Jersey, one of which is Atlantic City. Once I felt that I had zoomed in enough, I opened the 1930s map of the Atlantic City area and placed it over the Streets basemap. Drawing on my experience with the Atlantic City Expressway and other major roads near Atlantic City, I picked intersections or unique roads that I found on both the basemap and the 1930s map and used these as my points of reference to align the 1930s map to the basemap. For example, I know there is a roundabout in Brigantine where there is a lighthouse; therefore, I found the roundabout on the 1930s map, put a point there, and placed the other point on the roundabout on the basemap. Even after two points, the 1930s map was well-aligned with the basemap.

### Assuming the reader is unfamiliar, contextualize your map. In other, what is this a map of? What kinds of space and place are being represented? Draw on Mapping Inequality and Amy Hillier's article.

According to Richard White, “…space is neither simply natural geography nor an empty container filled by history. It is rather something that human beings produce over time” (White, What is Spatial History?, 2010). Considering this, my map is of the place Atlantic City, New Jersey, and some of the surrounding cities such as Pleasantville, Absecon, and Brigantine. However, considering the idea of place, these cities constitute some of the “Shore Points” of Southern New Jersey, a popular tourist destination. Atlantic City itself is part of an island in the Atlantic Ocean, but it also consists of hotels, casinos, and the famous Atlantic City Boardwalk. There is so much history in this area, but it has recently been a space of tension due to its failing economy and increases in crime.

Considering Hillier’s article and the Mapping Inequality project, the Atlantic City area was mostly “Definitely Declining” in the 1930s. This means that it was “‘declining’ and subject to infiltration of a ‘low grade population’…referring largely to the presence of Jews and African Americans” (Hillier, Redlining in Philadelphia, 2002). Therefore, the physical place of Atlantic City was also a space of racial discrimination and tension. The “Definitely Declining” grade meant that people living in this area were “‘unlikely to qualify for mortgages and home loans. Builders and developers, likewise, could expect little or no financial backing if they chose to build in such risky neighborhoods’” (Hillier, Redlining in Philadelphia, 2002). The actual physical place of Atlantic City itself is dominated by these “Definitely Declining” grades and has one neighborhood deemed “Hazardous” and one neighborhood, which is on the Atlantic City-Ventnor border, considered “Still Desirable.” The “Still Desirable” neighborhood was described as “the only portion of Atlantic City proper which can be classed as still desireable residentially and it is having difficultly resisting encroachment of rooming house business from the east” (Mapping Inequality). The neighborhood consists of large beach-front properties, which is why it is given this grade. In addition, it was the “most desirable on the island prior to the development of Ventnor and Margate,” which suggests that Atlantic City is on the decline due to “infiltration of a ‘low grade population’” and, as a result, white families are moving to Ventnor and Margate (Mapping Inequality; Hillier, Redlining in Philadelphia, 2002). Drawing on my own experiences and knowledge of the area, Ventnor and Margate are known to be better off than Atlantic City; Margate even has a toll so that people have to pay to enter and leave the city, which makes it very exclusive and well-off.

### As Richard White states, "visualization and spatial history are not about producing illustrations or maps to communicate things that you have discovered by other means. It is a means of doing research; it generates questions that might otherwise go unasked, it reveals historical relations that might otherwise go unnoticed, and it undermines, or substantiates, stories upon which our versions of the past" (White, What is Spatial History?, 2010). What questions does your map generate about the past and the present?

### Pick a contemporary census tract using your map and compare/contrast with redlining from Mapping Inequality. Consider using Social Explorer to dive deeper. What can we learn about how the census tract/neighborhood has or hasn't changed?

### Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas (ex. "deep maps") outlined by Bodenhamer and Crampton, discuss the challenges of representing space and place as applied to your map. How might you be able to address some of these issues in the future?
