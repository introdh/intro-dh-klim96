I selected the journal of *Psychological Science* from 1994-2014 as my corpus. It is a peer-reviewed journal that publishes psychological research. It covers topics such as cognitive, social, developmental, and health psychology. The editor is D. Stephen Lindsay and it publishes 12 issues per year (Association for Psychological Science, website). I chose 1994-2014 because psychology research is always changing and progressing. Therefore, I am familiar with the most recent developments in psychology research, which makes it easy for me to label and analyze my topics. In addition, I can see how much the field of psychology has changed in the past 20 years.

Originally, I selected 25 topics for my topic model. However, when I looked at my topics, it incorrectly pulled out dates as part of the topic and there was too much overlap among topics. Therefore, I ended up re-running my code with 10 topics so there would be less overlap. Now the number of topics align with the topics covered in *Psychological Science*. 

However, the original problem I faced with the 25 topics does show that there have been many changes in psychological research in the past 20 years. Since there was a lot of overlap between topics, that means new terms have been developed within psychological concentrations due to new research and findings. In addition, specific years appeared with specific topics, which shows that certain topics may have become popular due to discoveries and changes made in those specific years. When clicking through the Word Index, I found that the 1990s belong to the Research Methods topic, 1999 belongs to the Child Development topic, the early 2000s belong in the Cognitive Psychology topic, and 2003, 2006, and 2008 appear in the Social Psychology topic. This aligns with my understanding of the field of psychology because many cognitive psychology is a recent development in the field and many methods require computers and newer technologies; therefore, it makes sense that cognitive psychology appears towards the early 2000s. It is possible that in the 1990s, the psychology was grappling with its methods to assert itself as a science, which is something the field is still doing today. In addition, with the recent interest in civil rights, it makes sense that the later early 2000s are associated with social psychology. 

One of the possibilities of topic modeling is that it “has the potential to reveal shifts in critical vocabulary that aren’t well described, and that don’t fit our received assumptions about the history of the discipline” (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012). My findings based on the years associated with certain topics reflects this possibility.

One of the limitations of topic modeling is myself. According to Brett, “The only way to know if your results are useful or wildly off the mark is to have a general idea of what you should be seeing” (Brett, JDH, 2012). Though I am a psychology major, I am far from being an expert of the field. Therefore, my interpretation and understanding of my topics is limited by my own knowledge of psychology. Another limitation of topic modeling is the process itself; sometimes a computer is not subjective—or “human”—enough to understand the nuances between words that are spelled the same way but mean different things or words/phrases that are spelled differently but mean the same thing. For example, in the Blevins reading, he found that Martha Ballard refers to her daughter as “Dagt Lambd” instead of “Dolly” after her daughter married. Though he found this change in his topic model, Blevins had to read the corpus itself—not just analyze the model—to find the reason for this difference (Blevins, personal blog, 10-19-2009).
