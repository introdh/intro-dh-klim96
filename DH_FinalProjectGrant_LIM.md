## Abstract

The goal of this project is to study and map the locations Asian characters are seen in television sitcoms and comedies. By doing this, I hope to show non-literal space and physical place can effect the way Asians are represented in the media and how this challenges and upholds Asian stereotypes. Asians have been invisible in Hollywood, where there has been a long practice of whitewashing and using yellow face and brown face. However, Asian actors are becoming more outspoken about the lack of representation and are finding some success in television; some examples are the comedies *Fresh Off the Boat*, *Master of None*, and *The Mindy Project* which feature Asians as the main characters. Despite these successes, there is still work to be done to get accurate and equal representation in the media. To begin this project, I plan to map the aforementioned three television shows using ArcGIS and offer analysis of the stereotypes challenged and upheld in the locations featured on the shows. Similar projects include Distant Viewing, Mapping St. Petersburg, and Civil War Washington; however, this project is the first of its kind to explore Asian representation through mapping space and place. As the project grows, I will include American sitcoms and comedies from 1994-present and host it on a website so that it is easily accessible to all. The project hopes to give voice to all the Asians who have been silenced in the media and further the scope of research in Asian representation. Through this project, I can show not only how Hollywood is beginning to show the complexity of Asian characters but also how we still have a long way to go to bring about accurate Asian representation in media.

## Narrative
### Enhancing the Humanities
*“There probably is a Pradeep who runs a convenience store, and I have nothing against him, but why can’t there be a Pradeep just once who’s, like, an architect, or he designs mittens or does one of the jobs Bradley Cooper’s characters do in movies?”*

*Aziz Ansari as Dev Shah in [Master of None](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_None), “Indians on TV”*

How are Asians represented in television sitcoms? What physical places and non-literal spaces do they occupy? What can place and spare tell us about representation?

According to Bodenhamer, “[f]or many humanists, space itself became less geographical and more metaphorical, as scholars found richer meaning in conceptual space—for instance, gendered space, racialized space, or the body as space—than in categories related to the physical environment, the traditional frame of definition for spatial terms” (Bodenhamer, “Beyond GIS: Geospatial Technologies and the Future of History,” 2013). 
Therefore, my project hopes to consider literal, geographic place in relation to fictional racialized space. I plan to do this by mapping the places where audiences see Asian characters in different television shows. I will focus on American sitcoms and comedies from 1994 to the present so that I can include Margaret Cho’s [*All-American Girl*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-American_Girl_(1994_TV_series)), the first prime time sitcom featuring an Asian American cast. 
I will be mapping American sitcoms and comedies because this genre is uniquely positioned to either challenge or uphold Asian stereotypes for entertainment.
For example, many shows tend to “throw Asians under the bus” for easy laughs or to make fun of our culture; one such show is *Sabrina the Teenage Witch*. 

![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-02%20at%206.07.35%20PM.png)

In the Season 1 episode, “Meeting Dad’s Girlfriend,” the characters magically conjure Chinese food for dinner and, as a result, all the white characters are speaking in Chinese and wearing stereotypical Chinese clothing while a laugh track plays in the background. 
In the next scene, Sabrina approaches her cat Salem and speaks to him in Chinese; he yells at her, “Speak English!” and the laugh track plays again. 

![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/nicewhitefamily.gif)

The white characters are misappropriating Chinese culture and are using Chinese stereotypes for the sake of entertainment. In addition, poking fun at Salem yelling “Speak English!” can be hurtful to Asians who have immigrated to the United States but have yet to learn English; it also supports the dominant ideology that minorities must assimilate into American culture to be accepted as Americans.

On the other hand, shows like [*Fresh Off the Boat*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_Off_the_Boat) and [*The Mindy Project*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mindy_Project) use the sitcom and comedy genres to challenge Asian stereotypes. 
In one scene from *Fresh Off the Boat*, Jessica Huang says, “I’m gonna treat myself to a pedicure done by a white lady. That’s when you know you’ve made it.” 

![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/JessicaHuang.jpg)

Jessica’s quote implies that most nail salons are run by Asians, which is a well-known stereotype. 
However, she turns the stereotype of white women getting their nails done by Asians on its head and it is comedic. 

In *The Mindy Project*, Mindy Lahiri is a seemingly dainty person due to her short stature and tendency to dress in very preppy, cute outfits; she is also a woman and Asian, which stereotypically positions her as a weak person.
However, she is always challenging that by being blunt and loud, and in the image below, she is doing it by *demanding*—not asking—to be dominant.

Through my project, I plan to show how space and place can uphold, challenge, and create racial stereotypes and identities. I will map each show using ArcGIS. In the process of mapping the shows, I will start with a basemap and layer each show’s locations over the basemap; therefore, each show will be its own layer and there will be a slider to change the season that is being viewed. There will be points on the map that will show the physical locations that the Asian characters have visited in the show. Clicking on each point will reveal information about that particular location such as what physical place it is, who visited the place, when the character visited the place, analysis of the sort of space created by allowing Asians within it, and how it challenges or upholds stereotypes. My map will be hosted on a website like another University of Richmond project, [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.105/-94.583&opacity=0.8). In addition, with new shows and episodes always coming out, this project will be a work in progress.

This project furthers humanities inquiry through media studies, Asian studies, Asian-American studies, identity, and rhetoric. My project grapples with the question of how what we see on TV impacts our perception of Asians. In the media and in Hollywood, Asians have been silenced for so long, so my project plans to bring this to light. In addition, it is using mapping, space, and place to show how these can create identities. Since Asians in media have been silenced for so long, this project focuses on what Asians can and cannot *do* as opposed to what they *say* because sometimes what they say does not give the viewer the whole picture. Television is visual, so this project will focus more on the visuals and characters' actions. Finally, this project hopes to further the scope of research on Asian representation in American media. 

There is still a lack of Asian roles on major TV networks and Hollywood films. According to the *New York Times* article [“Asian-American Actors Are Fighting for Visibility. They Will Not Be Ignored.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/movies/asian-american-actors-are-fighting-for-visibility-they-will-not-be-ignored.html) by Amanda Hess, “…more than half of film, television and streaming properties feature zero named or speaking Asian characters…”

![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/chineseontv4.jpg)

Asian actors are fighting for representation in the media. As a result, many aspiring Asian actors, directors, and writers take to YouTube to showcase their talent because they not only have creative control over their content but also YouTube offers them a space where Asian voices are accepted. Despite Hollywood’s belief that people do not want to see Asians in TV and film, many famous YouTubers are Asian and receive millions of views on their videos. However, YouTube is not considered as “legit” of an entertainment service as Netflix, Hulu, or traditional TV networks. In addition, viewers must want to specifically watch these Asian performers to be exposed to Asians in media. Therefore, though there is an alternative, it is still important for Asians to receive equal and accurate representation on streaming media, television, and film.

Furthermore, despite the progress Asian actors have experienced with ABC’s *Fresh Off the Boat*, Mindy Kaling getting her own TV show on Fox, and Aziz Ansari rising to fame from NBC’s *Parks and Recreation*, Asians are still being pushed to the Internet and only specific audiences have access to their work. Despite getting picked up by Fox, Kaling’s *The Mindy Project* was eventually cancelled and streamed its final three seasons on Hulu. Ansari’s show, *Master of None*, is a Netflix Original Series and can only be found on Netflix. Both Hulu and Netflix require subscriptions. Therefore, access is restricted to those who can afford it and seek it out; there is not much open access to Asians in media.

Since there is still not much open access to Asians in media and there is a lack of Asian representation, a project studying Asian representation in existing television shows is important to show how what we view on TV impacts our perception of Asians. Using the digital humanities method of mapping in a new way can offer a fresh interpretation of Asian representation. This project has a unique goal of showing how space and place can uphold, challenge, and create racial stereotypes and identities. As comedian and actress Margaret Cho said, “It’s that we [Asians] have been invisible for so long we don’t even know what we can do.” Asian representation is important but almost nonexistent. Hollywood is still problematically whitewashing Asian characters and putting white actors in yellow and brown face, which takes jobs away from Asian actors and actresses. Accurate and increased representation is important so the public is exposed to more complex Asian characters that will challenge their preconceived notions of Asian people. Furthermore, it is important for Asian children who, like me, do not see people who look like them on TV. Growing up, if I saw Asian characters in a television show, they were portrayed as stereotypes like ninjas and karate masters and I could not relate to that. Asians are so much more dynamic than that. We are not just Chinese or Japanese; we are Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, and more. We are not just ninjas or manicurists; we are lawyers, business owners, actors—maybe even mitten designers.

With my project, I can show not only how Hollywood is beginning to show the complexity of Asian characters but also how we still have a long way to go to bring about accurate Asian representation in media.

### Environmental Scan
Some projects that are similar to mine are Distant Viewing, Mapping St. Petersburg, and Civil War Washington. [Distant Viewing](https://distantviewing.org/) developed a computational technique to analyze 14 television shows from the Network Era of American TV (1952-1985). When analyzing moving images, it conducts facial detection, character disambiguation, and scene classification. The project also shows how characters can use visual space. I will most likely utilize the computational technique from Distant Viewing for efficiency, especially as the project grows, when mapping these shows; I will need the facial recognition to keep track of Asian characters and I can use scene classification to determine where these characters go. However, I may need to make sure that this technique will be able to recognize Asian faces. Currently, the project has looked at *Bewitched* and *Laverne & Shirley*, which feature white actors and actresses. Therefore, I may need to work with Distant Viewing’s Dr. Tilton and Dr. Arnold to adapt their technique to recognize Asian faces.

[Mapping St. Petersburg](http://www.mappingpetersburg.org/site/) maps literary texts, such at Dostoevsky’s *Crime and Punishment*, that take place in St. Petersburg to the actual physical map of the city. Similar to my project, Mapping St. Petersburg maps fantasy to reality. I believe they say it best on their website when they write, “The developing field of literary geography is beginning to examine the role of real place, as opposed to symbolic space, in literature. Understanding the representation of real geographies in literary works has the potential to explain our response to our physical surroundings and the way the landscape in which we live shapes our culture.” The goal of this project is similar to mine and it touches on some themes I want to explore in my own project. In addition, its maps utilizes pins; when the viewer clicks on a pin, a box pops up that offers a quote from *Crime and Punishment* that relates to the point. However, the pins do not offer any analysis or give any real-life description of the physical place. Since I would like to offer analysis of the places featured in my maps, I will adapt Mapping St. Petersburg’s pin feature in my own project.

![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-03%20at%207.42.47%20PM.png)

[Civil War Washington](http://civilwardc.org/maps/flex/) uses different techniques—literary studies, history, geography, and mapping—to examine the Civil War’s impact on Washington D.C. from different perspectives. In the map function, the viewer can see things such as colored churches, census records, and more from March 1860 to July 1867. My maps will probably be most similar to this project’s and I plan to adapt their mapping techniques for my own use. For example, they have a time slider feature in which the user can change the date of the map; I could adapt this feature to a “season slider” in which the user can change the season of the show they are viewing.

![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-03%20at%207.41.38%20PM.png)

Though these three projects are similar to mine, none of them explore Asian representation in media through space and place; therefore, my project is the first of its kind. However, I will adapt some of the methods and ideas these projects explore to my own work.

### History of the Project
To begin this project, I analyzed the *Master of None* episode “Indians on TV” (Season 1, Episode 4). This episode provided the inspiration for my project. I offer some of my initial analyses below.

In this episode, Dev is seen in multiple auditions, which challenge and uphold Asian stereotypes. In his first audition, the room is filled with other Indian actors. This challenges Asian stereotypes because we do not usually think of Asians as actors; more importantly, we do not think about the process Asian actors must go through to be seen on TV. Race becomes very salient in this space. Next, Dev enters the audition room in which a white woman is running the audition and an Asian young woman acts as her assistant and works the camera. Again, we see Asians in media, which challenges the stereotype that Asians are not actors or filmmakers; however, this is all the “behind the scenes” work of creating a show so the Asians in this room are never seen on the screen of the fictional show they are working on. In addition, the dialogue in this audition room upholds stereotypes of Asians since the white woman is asking Dev to say his lines in an Indian accent. Also, the white woman has the power in this room and exerting her control over Dev to make him stick to his stereotype. However, he challenges this by refusing to do the accent and arguing with the woman. Therefore, this place becomes an obstacle for Asians in media.

![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-14%20at%208.49.24%20PM.png)
![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-14%20at%208.49.37%20PM.png)
![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-14%20at%208.49.50%20PM.png)

After the audition, Dev meets up with his friend Ravi, who is also Indian, in a coffee shop. Here, we see two Asians, who are both actors, as the characters in focus in this physical place. They discuss the problems of Indian representation on TV and Ravi offers his defense for upholding the Indian stereotype and using an Indian accent in his audition. Coffee shops are spaces where friends gather to catch up; however, by allowing two Asians to have an honest dialogue about the lack of representation on TV, this turns the physical place into a racialized space that challenges stereotypes.

![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-14%20at%208.52.22%20PM.png)

In the second audition, Ravi and Dev are in another audition for a show that is “open ethnicity.” There are actors of different ethnicities sitting in the waiting room, which turns the physical place of the audition into a space that challenges the traditional audition practice of requesting actors of a specific ethnicity.

These three places from *Master of None*—the first audition, the coffee shop, and the second audition—uphold and challenge Asian stereotypes in different ways. In these locations, we see Asians in places that audiences do not usually see them in. However, by allowing Asians into these places and having the aforementioned conversations in these places, it changes these physical places into spaces that are controlled by Asians, make race more salient, and challenge preconceived notions of Asians.

### Work Plan
![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/BallaLittle.gif)

For my project’s launch, I will start with mapping *Fresh Off the Boat*, *Master of None*, and *The Mindy Project*. *Fresh Off the Boat* takes place in Orlando, while *Master of None* and *The Mindy Project* take place in New York City. Though the goal is for the project to expand and include other shows and maps, I will begin with these three shows because they are some of the most popular sitcoms/comedies right now that feature an Asian as the main character. In addition, they feature Constance Wu and Aziz Ansari in main roles, and they are well-known for promoting Asian representation in TV and speaking out against Hollywood white-washing and the lack of Asian roles.

To begin mapping these shows, I will first collect all the available episodes of these shows. *Fresh Off the Boat* season four is still airing on ABC, so I will collect the episodes from seasons one to three. Next, I will work with Dr. Tilton from Distant Viewing to adapt her project’s computational technique to mine; once that is completed, I will use this method to begin scanning the shows for Asian characters and their locations.

After I have collected the locations and characters from the different shows, I will begin to develop my maps. Each show will be its own layer over the basemap with pins in each location visited on the show. I will work on each show season by season, using a season slider adapted from Civil War Washington, and location by location, writing up background and analyses for each location. During this stage, Dr. Tilton will act as my mentor and evaluate the results of my project. Professors from the Rhetoric & Communication Studies department, who will also be members of my advisory board, will evaluate my work as well.

Since there is a lot of work to be done since I am mapping three shows that have multiple seasons, my lack of staff may hinder progress. To combat this, I will reach out to other students in the Rhetoric & Communication Studies department and students in Asian culture clubs to act as collaborators. Another problem I may run into is access to these shows; *Master of None* is only available on Netflix, *The Mindy Project* is available on Hulu, and *Fresh Off the Boat* currently runs on ABC. The most problematic show would be *Fresh Off the Boat* since it is on ABC; many of its earlier episodes may not be readily accessible on the network’s website. However, with funding from this grant, I will have money to buy subscriptions to Netflix and Hulu and can buy *Fresh Off the Boat* episodes on Amazon Video.

## Staff
I will act as the project director. I will be in charge of the organization and schedule of the project. In addition, I will serve as the main creator and analyzer of the maps. 

![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/jessicahuang.gif)

If needed, I will recruit students from the University of Richmond Rhetoric & Communication Studies department and students in Asian culture clubs to assist me; however, I plan to be the main contributor on this project. 

Dr. Tilton will be my main mentor for this project. She will also act as a collaborator since she, along with Dr. Arnold, will help me adapt the Distant Viewing methods for my project. 

Since I will be conducting this project through the University of Richmond Rhetoric & Communication Studies department, the department faculty will act as my advisory board. The members include Dr. Paul Achter, Dr. Timothy Barney, Dr. Eva Hageman, Dr. Nicole Maurantonio, Dr. Mari Lee Mifsud, and Dr. Andrea Vickery. The advisory board will evaluate my work and serve as mentors.

## Final Project and Dissemination
The project will be hosted on a website, much like Mapping St. Petersburg and Civil War Washington. I will create social media accounts such as Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr to promote the project and the issue of Asian representation in media.

With new shows and episodes always coming out, this project will be a work in progress. The website will provide information on the background of the project, the goals, and the methods use. In addition, I plan to also feature a blog on the website, which future contributors could offer their own thoughts on the project, Asian representation in the media, different television shows, and more. If I need to adapt Distant Viewing’s computational techniques to recognize Asian faces, I will make sure that this technique will be available for free on my site. I will also have a contact page where visitors can leave comments or request detailed versions of my methods so the project can be adapted for different shows, genres, or racial representations. A project such as this can be adapted for different purposes and it would be interesting and important to see how other races are represented on TV through space and place.

To make my site accessible to people with disabilities, I will have an audio version of the written portions of the website. These audio versions will also have extra descriptions of the location being described so that visitors who have difficulty viewing the site will be able to understand the physical locations from the shows.
