### Enhancing the Humanities
How are Asians represented in television sitcoms? What physical places and non-literal spaces do they occupy? What can place and spare tell us about representation?

According to Bodenhamer, “[f]or many humanists, space itself became less geographical and more metaphorical, as scholars found richer meaning in conceptual space—for instance, gendered space, racialized space, or the body as space—than in categories related to the physical environment, the traditional frame of definition for spatial terms” (Bodenhamer, “Beyond GIS: Geospatial Technologies and the Future of History,” 2013). 
Therefore, my project hopes to consider literal, geographic place in relation to fictional racialized space. I plan to do this by mapping the places where audiences see Asian characters in different TV shows. 
I will focus on American sitcoms and comedies from 1994 to the present so that I can include Margaret Cho’s [*All-American Girl*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-American_Girl_(1994_TV_series)), the first prime time sitcom featuring an Asian American cast.
I will be mapping American sitcoms and comedies because this genre is uniquely positioned to either challenge or uphold Asian stereotypes for entertainment.
For example, many shows tend to “throw Asians under the bus” for easy laughs or to make fun of our culture; one such show is *Sabrina the Teenage Witch*.

In the Season 1 episode, “Meeting Dad’s Girlfriend,” the characters magically conjure Chinese food for dinner and, as a result, all the white characters are speaking in Chinese and wearing stereotypical Chinese clothing while a laugh track plays in the background. 
In the next scene, Sabrina approaches her cat Salem and speaks to him in Chinese; he yells at her, “Speak English!” and the laugh track plays again. 

On the other hand, shows like *Fresh Off the Boat* and *The Mindy Project* use the sitcom/comedy genre to challenge stereotypes. 
In one scene from *Fresh Off the Boat*, Jessica Huang says, “I’m gonna treat myself to a pedicure done by a white lady. That’s when you know you’ve made it.”

Jessica’s quote implies that most nail salons are run by Asians, which is a well-known stereotype. 
However, she turns the stereotype of white women getting their nails done by Asians on its head and it is comedic.
In *The Mindy Project*, Mindy Lahiri is a seemingly dainty person due to her short stature and tendency to dress in very preppy, cute outfits; she is also a woman and Asian, which stereotypically positions her as a weak person.
However, she is always challenging that by being blunt and loud, and in the image below, she is doing it by *demanding*—not asking—to be dominant.
