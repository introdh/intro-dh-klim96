## Abstract
## Narrative
### Enhancing the Humanities
How are Asians represented in television sitcoms? What physical places and non-literal spaces do they occupy? What can place and spare tell us about representation?

According to Bodenhamer, “[f]or many humanists, space itself became less geographical and more metaphorical, as scholars found richer meaning in conceptual space—for instance, gendered space, racialized space, or the body as space—than in categories related to the physical environment, the traditional frame of definition for spatial terms” (Bodenhamer, “Beyond GIS: Geospatial Technologies and the Future of History,” 2013). 
Therefore, my project hopes to consider literal, geographic place in relation to fictional racialized space. I plan to do this by mapping the places where audiences see Asian characters in different TV shows. 
I will focus on American sitcoms and comedies from 1994 to the present so that I can include Margaret Cho’s [*All-American Girl*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-American_Girl_(1994_TV_series)), the first prime time sitcom featuring an Asian American cast.
I will be mapping American sitcoms and comedies because this genre is uniquely positioned to either challenge or uphold Asian stereotypes for entertainment.
For example, many shows tend to “throw Asians under the bus” for easy laughs or to make fun of our culture; one such show is *Sabrina the Teenage Witch*.

In the Season 1 episode, “Meeting Dad’s Girlfriend,” the characters magically conjure Chinese food for dinner and, as a result, all the white characters are speaking in Chinese and wearing stereotypical Chinese clothing while a laugh track plays in the background. 
In the next scene, Sabrina approaches her cat Salem and speaks to him in Chinese; he yells at her, “Speak English!” and the laugh track plays again. 

On the other hand, shows like *Fresh Off the Boat* and *The Mindy Project* use the sitcom/comedy genre to challenge stereotypes. 
In one scene from *Fresh Off the Boat*, Jessica Huang says, “I’m gonna treat myself to a pedicure done by a white lady. That’s when you know you’ve made it.”

Jessica’s quote implies that most nail salons are run by Asians, which is a well-known stereotype. 
However, she turns the stereotype of white women getting their nails done by Asians on its head and it is comedic.
In *The Mindy Project*, Mindy Lahiri is a seemingly dainty person due to her short stature and tendency to dress in very preppy, cute outfits; she is also a woman and Asian, which stereotypically positions her as a weak person.
However, she is always challenging that by being blunt and loud, and in the image below, she is doing it by *demanding*—not asking—to be dominant.

### Environmental Scan
Some projects that are similar to mine are Distant Viewing, Mapping St. Petersburg, and Civil War Washington. [Distant Viewing](https://distantviewing.org/) developed a computational technique to analyze 14 television shows from the Network Era of American TV (1952-1985). When analyzing moving images, it conducts facial detection, character disambiguation, and scene classification. The project also shows how characters can use visual space. I will most likely utilize the computational technique from Distant Viewing for efficiency, especially as the project grows, when mapping these shows; I will need the facial recognition to keep track of Asian characters and I can use scene classification to determine where these characters go. However, I may need to make sure that this technique will be able to recognize Asian faces. Currently, the project has looked at *Bewitched* and *Laverne & Shirley*, which feature white actors and actresses. Therefore, I may need to work with Distant Viewing’s Dr. Tilton and Dr. Arnold to adapt their technique to recognize Asian faces.

[Mapping St. Petersburg](http://www.mappingpetersburg.org/site/) maps literary texts, such at Dostoevsky’s *Crime and Punishment*, that take place in St. Petersburg to the actual physical map of the city. Similar to my project, Mapping St. Petersburg maps fantasy to reality. I believe they say it best on their website when they write, “The developing field of literary geography is beginning to examine the role of real place, as opposed to symbolic space, in literature. Understanding the representation of real geographies in literary works has the potential to explain our response to our physical surroundings and the way the landscape in which we live shapes our culture.” The goal of this project is similar to mine and it touches on some themes I want to explore in my own project. In addition, its maps utilizes pins; when the viewer clicks on a pin, a box pops up that offers a quote from *Crime and Punishment* that relates to the point. However, the pins do not offer any analysis or give any real-life description of the physical place. Since I would like to offer analysis of the places featured in my maps, I will adapt Mapping St. Petersburg’s pin feature in my own project.

[Civil War Washington](http://civilwardc.org/maps/flex/) uses different techniques—literary studies, history, geography, and mapping—to examine the Civil War’s impact on Washington D.C. from different perspectives. In the map function, the viewer can see things such as colored churches, census records, and more from March 1860 to July 1867. My maps will probably be most similar to this project’s and I plan to adapt their mapping techniques for my own use. For example, they have a time slider feature in which the user can change the date of the map; I could adapt this feature to a “season slider” in which the user can change the season of the show they are viewing.

Though these three projects are similar to mine, none of them explore Asian representation in media through space and place; therefore, my project is the first of its kind. However, I will adapt some of the methods and ideas these projects explore to my own work.

### History of the Project

### Work Plan
![alt text](https://github.com/introdh/intro-dh-klim96/blob/master/BallaLittle.gif)

For my project’s launch, I will start with mapping *Fresh Off the Boat*, *Master of None*, and *The Mindy Project*. *Fresh Off the Boat* takes place in Orlando, while *Master of None* and *The Mindy Project* take place in New York City. Though the goal is for the project to expand and include other shows and maps, I will begin with these three shows because they are some of the most popular sitcoms/comedies right now that feature an Asian as the main character. In addition, they feature Constance Wu and Aziz Ansari in main roles, and they are well-known for promoting Asian representation in TV and speaking out against Hollywood white-washing and the lack of Asian roles.

To begin mapping these shows, I will first collect all the available episodes of these shows. *Fresh Off the Boat* season four is still airing on ABC, so I will collect the episodes from seasons one to three. Next, I will work with Dr. Tilton from Distant Viewing to adapt her project’s computational technique to mine; once that is completed, I will use this method to begin scanning the shows for Asian characters and their locations.

After I have collected the locations and characters from the different shows, I will begin to develop my maps. Each show will be its own layer over the basemap with pins in each location visited on the show. I will work on each show season by season, using a season slider adapted from Civil War Washington, and location by location, writing up background and analyses for each location. During this stage, Dr. Tilton will act as my mentor and evaluate the results of my project. Professors from the Rhetoric & Communication Studies department, who will also be members of my advisory board, will evaluate my work as well.

Since there is a lot of work to be done since I am mapping three shows that have multiple seasons, my lack of staff may hinder progress. To combat this, I will reach out to other students in the Rhetoric & Communication Studies department and students in Asian culture clubs to act as collaborators. Another problem I may run into is access to these shows; *Master of None* is only available on Netflix, *The Mindy Project* is available on Hulu, and *Fresh Off the Boat* currently runs on ABC. The most problematic show would be *Fresh Off the Boat* since it is on ABC; many of its earlier episodes may not be readily accessible on the network’s website. However, with funding from this grant, I will have money to buy subscriptions to Netflix and Hulu and can buy *Fresh Off the Boat* episodes on Amazon Video.

## Staff
I will act as the project director. I will be in charge of the organization and schedule of the project. In addition, I will serve as the main creator and analyzer of the maps. If needed, I will recruit students from the University of Richmond Rhetoric & Communication Studies department and students in Asian culture clubs to assist me; however, I plan to be the main contributor on this project. 

Dr. Tilton will be my main mentor for this project. She will also act as a collaborator since she, along with Dr. Arnold, will help me adapt the Distant Viewing methods for my project. 

Since I will be conducting this project through the University of Richmond Rhetoric & Communication Studies department, the department faculty will act as my advisory board. The members include Dr. Paul Achter, Dr. Timothy Barney, Dr. Eva Hageman, Dr. Nicole Maurantonio, Dr. Mari Lee Mifsud, and Dr. Andrea Vickery. The advisory board will evaluate my work and serve as mentors.

## Final Project and Dissemination
The project will be hosted on a website, much like Mapping St. Petersburg and Civil War Washington. With new shows and episodes always coming out, this project will be a work in progress. I will create social media accounts such as Twitter and Instagram to promote the project. In addition, I plan to also feature a blog on the website, which future contributors could offer their own thoughts on the project, Asian representation in the media, different TV shows, and more. If I need to adapt Distant Viewing’s computational techniques to recognize Asian faces, I will make sure that this technique will be available for free on my site.
